# FFT
I wrote this FFT program (using an algorithm from Introduction to Numerical Methods by Chapra and Canale)
in 1992/1993 as part of my graduate work in mechanical engineering for processing accelerometer signal data.
It certainly wouldn't pass the commercial software standards, but is an indication of my potential as a
programmer with the right training.
