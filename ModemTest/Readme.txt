These files are from when I was a contract programmer for EF Data writing final test scripts.  I used the C language to
build a set of programs that would automate the final tests of the SDM-100 and SDM-8000 modems which basically was
communicating with the modem through RS-232 to set it according to the final test plan.  I wrote this code from late 1993
to May 1994 when I left to take my first "real" engineering job.
