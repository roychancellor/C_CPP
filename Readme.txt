This is probably the coolest program I have ever written.  I wrote this during 1992/1993 when I was in graduate school
at Texas A&M studying mechanical engineering - specifically, non-linear dynamic systems.  The program can animate a damped,
driven pendulum allowed to travel through angles of arbitrary size. When the angle is large enough, chaotic behavior
begins. The program can perform all sorts of data displays, such as phase-plane plots and Poincare maps. It can store data
to a file for later analysis, such as FFT or making bifurcation plots.

Unfortunately, it requires a DOS window to run and a specific directory structure. Hey, I wasn't a professional coder!
A long term goal is to convert this into Java (or C++) with a more modern GUI.
